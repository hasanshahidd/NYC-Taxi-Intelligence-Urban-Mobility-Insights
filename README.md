## üîç About the Project

**NYC Taxi Intelligence: Urban Mobility Insights** is an in-depth analysis of New York taxi trends. This project leverages:
- **Python:** For data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying critical thinking to uncover hidden trends.
- **Excel:** To store and manage the raw data efficiently.
- **PowerBI:** To create interactive dashboards that provide actionable insights into NYC taxi operations.

This project reflects not only technical proficiency but also strong time management and critical thinking skills applied during the analysis process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow & Insights

1. **Data Storage & Preparation:**  
   - Raw data is securely stored and managed in Excel.
   - Python scripts (Jupyter/IPython notebooks) are used for data cleaning and performing EDA.

2. **Data Analysis & Dashboard Creation:**  
   - Cleaned data is visualized and explored using PowerBI.
   - The PowerBI dashboards showcase a variety of insights on taxi trends, including ride frequency, peak usage times, and geospatial patterns in NYC.
   - The dashboards were built with a focus on clarity and interactivity, making the data accessible and easy to interpret.

3. **Critical Skills Applied:**  
   - **Critical Thinking:** Evaluating data quality and uncovering meaningful patterns.
   - **Time Management:** Efficiently managing the analysis workflow from data ingestion to dashboard delivery.
